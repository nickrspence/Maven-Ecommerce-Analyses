Maven Analytics created a fictitious eCommerce retail company named
Maven Factory with a database storing 3 years of business data. I will
pretend to be a data analyst to investigate their performance and offer
some recommendations based on my findings.

I will split up the analyses into two sections:

1)  First 18 months: '2012-04-01' to '2013-09-31'

2)  Full \~ 3 years : '2012-04-01' to '2014-12-31'

I have commented throughout my SQL scripts to show my analytical thought
process.

-   Most of the data outputs will be trending on a quarterly basis to
    maintain a reasonable frame size of data

For the first 18 months of data (SEGMENT 1), I investigated exploratory
trends including:

-   Trending website traffic, orders, and session-to-order conversion
    rates

-   Trending website traffic and sales broken out by advertising
    campaigns

-   Hour of day sales analysis

-   Website pages funnel analysis

-   Landing page click through rate analysis

-   Device type sales comparison

For the full \~ 3 years of data (SEGMENT 2), I provided some
comprehensive analysis that the company owner might present to investors
to demonstrate long term growth. Analyses include:

-   Trending website traffic, orders, conversion rates, revenue per
    order, and revenue per session

-   Trending organic search volume vs. paid search volume

-   Product cross sell analysis

-   Trending for repeat vs. first time website visitors on sessions,
    order conversion rate, and revenue per visit
